# Solar-System-Simulation
Inspired by a youtuber in the Unity game engine, I designed my own solar system with the hope of perhaps adding some flight mechanics later. At the moment it only has planet gravity and player gravity.

Note: Original code can be found in src/ServerScriptService/Visualize.server.lua and src/ServerStorage/PlanetManager.lua
