# Solar-System-Simulation
Inspired by a youtuber in the Unity game engine, I designed my own solar system with the hope of perhaps adding some flight mechanics later. At the moment it only has planet gravity and player gravity.

Notes: 
1. Most of the original code can be found in src/ServerScriptService/Visualize.server.lua and src/ServerStorage/PlanetManager.lua
2. The other lua files you may find are related to the open source wall stick library that roblox user EgoMoose created.
3. Plugin Rojo may be used to import these files into Studio
